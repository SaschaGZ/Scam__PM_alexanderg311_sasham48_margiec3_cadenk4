<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>Our website will act as a public live feed of blog posts <br>  
__User Features__ <br>
 - Users will be able to create accounts and log in <br>
 - Users can view other blog posts without being logged in <br>
 - Only logged-in users will be able to create blogs <br>
 - Logged-in users can edit previous blogs <br>
 - Blogs will be displayed chronologically, with more recent posts at the top <br>
 - Logged in users can switch between a page with only their own blogs and a page with all of the blogs on the site <br>
__Site Features__ <br>
 - Blog posts will be stores in an SQLite database <br>
 - A table will be dedicated to storing user IDs and passwords. <br>
 - Each logged-in user will be have an individual table containing their blogs; the file will begin blank and grow by row as the user creates new blogs <br>
 - Each blog is given a table containing a column of entries and a column of texts, with each entry corresponding to each block of text. Similar to the above method, this file will begin blank and grow by row as entries are added.  <br>
