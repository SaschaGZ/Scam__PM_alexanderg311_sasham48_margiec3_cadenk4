<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>Our website will act as a public live feed of blog posts <br>  
<b></b>User Features</b> <br>
- Users will be able to create accounts and log in <br>
- Users can view other blog posts without being logged in <br>
- Only logged-in users will be able to create blogs <br>
- Logged-in users can edit previous blogs <br>
- Blogs will be displayed chronologically, with more recent posts at the top <br>

<b>Site Features</b> <br>
 - Blog posts will be stores in an SQLite database <br>
 - A table will be dedicated to storing user IDs and passwords. <br>
 - Each logged-in user will be have an individual table containing their blogs; the file will begin blank and grow by row as the user creates new blogs <br>
 - Each blog is given a table containing a column of entries and a column of texts, with each entry corresponding to each block of text. Similar to the above method, this file will begin blank and grow by row as entries are added.  <br>
Blogs will be public and can be viewed by all members of the site, regardless of whether or not a given user is logged in. <br>
